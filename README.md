# WordPress Code Challenge for Mediusware
First, download and open WAMP to run the Apache server. Type "localhost" in your browser and WAMP configurations will come up. From there go to "phpmyadmin", the username should be "root" and leave the password blank. Create a database and name it "product_variation". Download or clone the project from this repo. Copy the "product variation" folder to the www destination of the WAMP folder (or similar for XAMP). Open your browser and write "localhost/product variation" to open the site. As WordPress is already in the repo, you should see the installation section of WordPress. Type "product_variation" in the Database portion, username should be "root" and leave the password blank. Next, the WordPress dashboard should come up. Go to Plugins and a plugin named "Color Swatches" should be seen. Activate the plugin to see it in action.
